# Simple-Harris-Corner-Detection / RANSAC feature matching / Homography
TransA.jpg and TransB.jpg are stereo images. The app finds features in each image and displays them for 
each image in blue and red dots on the pixel locations. Use the spacebar to proceed through the first set of images showing all 
the detected features. The app then produces a group of possible matches in TransB.jpg (blue dotted pixels in image on 
the right) for each features detected in TransA.jpg (green dotted pixels in the left image). A line is drawn
from the feature on the left to the location in the righthand image the app believes is the same location. Once all 
matching features have been preocessed the app produces the homography for the stereo images.
